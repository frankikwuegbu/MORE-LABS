LAB - VLANS on a Layer 3 Switch
This lab looks to show an understanding of local networks, broadcast domains and
how devices connected to a single switch can be "separated" into different broadcast
domains(VLAN). It also shows an understanding of the need for a layer 3 device often
a router to facilitate communication between networks. But more importantly it shows
how a special type of switch can perform those layer 3 functionalities when configured
correctly.
