LAB - VLAN, ROAS, ETHERCHANNEL
This lab shows an understanding of vitual lans which is used to seperate devices on
a switch into essentially, different networks. It uses the modern approach of Router On 
A Stick(ROAS) to establish a connection between these logically seperated networks and 
a single router interface via subinterfaces. It also adapts Ether Channel which makes
multiple physical switch interfaces act like a single port channel in a bid to increase
bandwidth and improve general network performance.
