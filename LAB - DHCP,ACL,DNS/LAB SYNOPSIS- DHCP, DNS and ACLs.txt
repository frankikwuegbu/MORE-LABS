LAB: DHCP, DNS and ACLs
This lab shows an understanding of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP),
Domain Name System (DNS) and Access Control Lists(ACL). 
the configurations in this lab allow for pings between hosts using their
human readable names (PC1, PC2, etc). It also allows for dynamic assignment of network
configurations such as ip address, domain name, default-gateway. The lab also filters
and manages access to specified networks or hosts.
There is more to the lab and it is a good proof of various concepts.
